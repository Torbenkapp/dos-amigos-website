                    <p>It all started with a simple flatbed trailer and a big dream. As two engineering students, we decided to combine our skills and passion for good food to create something special.</p>

                    <p>Every measurement was calculated, every beam was cut and welded by us. We designed the entire structure to be modular, a testament to our engineering roots.</p>
